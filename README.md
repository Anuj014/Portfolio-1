# Portfolio-1
I created a responsive portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and responsive design to showcase my skills and experience. 
It features sections on my 1-year experience as a Data Analyst, my front-end development internship, and my technical skills in web development and data analysis. The portfolio also includes qualifications and contact information for easy communication.
